What's Going On In There?

02 October 2015
In yesterday’s post I mentioned that in this series I would be covering a child’s physical, mental, and emotional health and wellbeing. I wholeheartedly believe that we can and should be doing more for children now, to set them up to live healthier lives in the future.
 Something that has surprised me for many years, for as long as I can remember, actually, is how little we know about our bodies. Our bodies are incredible!! It is so easy to forget, or to never acknowledge in the first place, the enormous amount that goes in our bodies, every single second.

And so much of this crazy magic happens without us even having to lift a finger, which is great, we can get so much other stuff done...but it does lead us to take things for granted, and never appreciate what’s happening on the inside until, one day, it maybe isn’t working as efficiently as it once was.

Every aspect of our physical, emotional, and mental health (or disorder) happens within this one body we have been given Knowing how something works allows us to know what we can do to support it in doing its designated job properly.

How does food actually reach our stomachs and then get used by the body?
How do our eyes see, or our hair grow?
Why do I get physical reactions from emotional situations?
In no way do I think that every child, or adult, should be forced into becoming a professor of anatomy and biology, but beyond knowing where the knee bone’s connected to the hip bone (is that even right??) I think knowing a little more about the functions and roles of the different parts of our bodies and what is needed for these body parts to function properly, can go a long way in promoting body awareness.

Body awareness and having and nurturing a good relationship with this one body of ours could be the key to optimal physical, mental, and emotional health.

Obviously there is too much that goes on in the body for any one person to understand, but luckily (!) I have another 29 days to try and squeeze in what I think are the most important things to know about the body, how it works, and how unfortunately, it sometimes breaks.
