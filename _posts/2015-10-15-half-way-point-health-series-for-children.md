Half Way Point: Health Series For Children

15 October 2015
We are halfway through this crazy challenge: write every day for the month of October.

Time to reflect on the first half and plan for a better second half.

Maybe I’ve taken on more of a mammoth task than I first assumed. I am, indeed, writing every day, but I wish I could write more, I wish I could write faster, and I wish the words in my head would more eloquently make their way onto my screen.

I guess that’s the beauty of this platform, there is always an edit button. So, while I may have committed to 31 days of writing, I may have unknowingly committed to an eternity of editing for this series, but that is fine.

The more I read, the more my love for the human body grows. Whether I am reading facts for kids, or more scientific, research based articles, I am intrigued with what is going on inside and I’m even more curious and excited for the discoveries that I am certain are not far away.

My only hope for this little challenge series is to spread some of this excitement and curiosity about the human body, all of its amazing features: known and yet to be discovered.
 As with most things in life, the more we know about it, the more we can choose to respect it.
