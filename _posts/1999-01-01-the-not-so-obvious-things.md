The Not­So­Obvious Things To Consider Before Moving Overseas


Moving to a different country is a dream for so many, and an incredibly lucky reality for a select
few. It is so much more than a holiday. You get to see a side of a country that goes beyond the
beautiful, tourist driven monuments, manicured gardens, or restaurants that have the tourist
experience in mind. You get to see and experience how another culture lives, works,  and plays
on any given day. It is easy to get swept up in the excitement and concentrate on the generic
logistical things you need before you go, like visas, passports, or quitting your job.
Beyond logistics, there are a few things to consider to ensure you remain healthy and happy
and have the time of your life.


What Are Your Goals?

After ‘where are you from?’, the most common question I get is ‘why are you here?’. It is great to
have an answer for others, but it is more important to know these answers for yourself. Being
spontaneous may be in your nature, but knowing your true intentions for such a major life
change can go a long way to helping you feel a sense of accomplishment. They can be simple,
superficial goals like learning to ski, or more thought provoking goals like experiencing living
with less, or learning what works or doesn’t for other cultures, to be able to use this knowledge
to somehow better the world. Keeping a goal journal is a great way of seeing how you progress
and change with experiences.


Acknowledge and Accept Distance From Your Old Life.

Everyone knows about home­sickness, but how do you deal with it? I was absolutely distraught
saying goodbye to family at the airport when I moved away. People would always say ‘you are
only ever 24 hours and a flight away, if you need to come back you can.’ This is technically true.
But when my grandfather passed away, buying a ticket home for the funeral was not something
that I was able to do, and that was heartbreaking.


Before you go away, acknowledge and accept the fact that life continues as normal even when
you are away having the time of your life. People get married, have babies, unfortunately pass
away, and you will not always be able to be there in person. As hard as it seems, explore
different ways to celebrate, congratulate, or grieve that don’t involve physically being in the
same room, or country, as others.


How Will You Connect?

You are an exciting, spontaneous and adventurous person for moving to another country.
People will be drawn to you and new friends will flock your way!! Right? It is possible, but not
probable. Before jetsetting off, it is a good idea to delve into some self awareness and really
know what type of personality you have. This will help you come up with some tactics for
meeting new people. By knowing if you are introverted, extroverted or a mixture of the two, you
can really know how to thrive. I am very introverted, so just heading out to a bar and striking up
conversations with strangers is not something I will ever do. But, seeking out a local running
group is something I would be comfortable doing, and something that would work for me.
You need to throw expectations out the window and be open to any new connections that come
your way. You never know who knows who, and you never know what unexpected connections
people can have. Even if you’re not comfortable approaching strangers, be open and kind if you
are ever approached.


Find Your Adult Security Blanket.

When everything around you is different, it can be easy to lose control and find yourself falling
into a negative headspace. If you plan for these unfamiliar situations you can give yourself the
best chance of staying happy and healthy. Find something from home that you love and use it to
your advantage when in your new country, use it to anchor yourself. Something simple is best, a
favourite album, a piece of clothing or jewelry, an activity like going for a run, a favourite family
recipe. Anytime you are feeling unsettled, use this security blanket as a kind of meditation,
something that helps centre you and reminds you of where you are, where you came from, and
how lucky you are to be enjoying these experiences.

Moving overseas can be life changing, but daunting. A little extra thought before leaving can
really set you up for an incredible experience that you will never forget..
