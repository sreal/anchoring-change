How Many Balloons??? The Lungs

05 October 2015
If the heart is the most important muscle in the body, I’d say the lungs are pretty close to the top of the list of important organs in the body. And just as the heart works not stop for us for our whole lives, so do the lungs, and most of the time, we forget they are even working.
 We have 2 lungs that sit nicely protected behind our sturdy ribs. The lungs draw in the air through the nose and pull out the oxygen for the blood to carry around the body. The lungs also allow us to breathe out unnecessary air that the body doesn’t need.

Whether you’re sleeping, eating, reading, relaxing, or playing sport, your lungs are ALWAYS breathing and it’s really only when we stop and think about it, that we know that they are doing it.

Every day we breathe around 22 000 times, but there are certain things that can speed up or slow down our breath. When we play sport, or run up a hill, we need to get more oxygen to our muscles, our lungs know this, so they speed up our breathing. When we sleep, our muscles aren’t doing much, so our lungs slow down. Sometimes, if we are scared, or nervous, we will hold our breath without even knowing it.

Just like the heart and the brain, our lungs do so much for us, that we really need to look after them and keep them happy. The lungs will work best if they are given lots of exercise, lots of colourful fruits and vegetable, and plenty of fresh and clean air, and water.

What happens when the lungs don't work properly?

A common way that the lungs misbehave in children is with asthma. You may have friends who have told you they have asthma, but what’s that? Asthma is a condition that affects the lungs and breathing. There are many different reasons why someone might get asthma

Dust in the air
Flowers or grass
Exercise
Even just cold weather
and they find themselves around one of these triggers, the airways from the nose to the lungs swell up and become tight, meaning it is very hard to get air into the lungs, or for some, it is hard getting the air out of the lungs.

If someone is having an asthma attack they may begin to cough, they may complain of chest pains, they may tell you it is hard for them to breathe. But, because our lungs help us to talk, if someone is having a very bad asthma attack, they may not be able to tell you anything at all.

Stay calm, and find an adult. If your friend has had asthma before, they probably have medication that they breathe in through their mouths, that helps to relax the airways and helps them to breathe.

If they haven’t had asthma before, they will be taken to a nurse or a doctor where they will get some medication and maybe some extra oxygen to help the lungs out a little. It is important to remember to remain calm and to find help immediately...your friend will thank you later. once they are feeling better.
