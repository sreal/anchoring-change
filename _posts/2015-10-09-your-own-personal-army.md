Your Own Personal Army

09 October 2015
I hope everyone is starting to understand just how amazing the body is, and how much cool stuff goes in inside without us even knowing. To protect all of these amazing processes from illnesses and infections, we have our own little army that fights for us, the immune system.
 Sometimes, things are working so well in the body, that it looks like a really great place to live, even to germs and bacteria. But if germs decide that they want to move into the body, they can distract your cells from doing their jobs, and things can start to go wrong, that’s when we get sick.
Luckily, the immune system (specifically, cells called white blood cells) is on the lookout for these imposters, and if they see them trying to move on in, they put up barriers and fight them until they are gone.

If you have a fever, or a running nose and cough, or if you get a splinter, your fingerit might feel hot and look red, it is easy to assume that you are sick. But these symptoms (along with many others) are all signs that your immune system is doing it’s job.

A fever is your body’s way of heating itself up so that the germs get too hot and don’t want to live there any more.
A running nose means that we will start to blow our nose and any germs that are caught up will be blown away into a tissue.
The redness and swelling around a splinter means your immune system has sent its troops to your finger, to push the splinter out.
Your lungs and intestines have special cells in their linings that produce a sticky mucous. This mucous is a part of the immune defense because it traps any germs that get into the body, and prevents them from getting into the blood and causing any damage.

Another line of defense is the acid that your stomach produces, It’s not until the germs get in there that they realise they really don’t want to live somewhere so acidic, so they find their own way out... usually they head for the toilet! It is so important to wash your hand well after using the toilet.

Unfortunately, sometimes germs can get through our defense system and we can get sick. Our immune system can get tired, just like we do, so there are a few things we can do to help it out

Eat lots of fresh fruits and vegetables, and keep sugary snacks to a minimum.
Play lots of sports! A strong healthy body = a strong and healthy immune system
Hand hygiene is extremely important. It not only protects us, but it also protects our friends and families, not everyone is lucky enough to have a great immune system
Get lots of rest. When you sleep, your immune system can rest too and it will be ready to fight for you tomorrow.
Vitamin D that we get when we go out in the sun is very helpful to our immune system. It is important to be sun safe, but to also allow ourselves a few rays of sunshine.
Isn’t it great to know you have your own army working away inside your body??? We are more like superheros than we think!
