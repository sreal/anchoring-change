Nutrition Basics Part 2: Vitamins & Minerals

13 October 2015
 Yesterday we talked about energy that we get from protein, carbohydrates, and fats, but where does that energy go? Sometimes it’s easier to notice when we don’t have energy, than when we do, but maybe you’ve felt that after eating a nice healthy meal for lunch, that it’s easier to play sport in the afternoon because you have lots of energy.

As well as playing sport however, lots of energy goes into growing, staying healthy, and fixing any parts of the body that may be damaged. As well as needing energy, growing, healing and staying healthy all require vitamins and minerals. Vitamins and minerals are tiny particles found in the fresh foods that we eat.

Since vitamins and minerals are used in the body for things like growing, and keeping our cells alive, the body LOVES to get these vitamins and minerals from other living things, because they already know how to do a great job! So, what can you find at the grocery store that is living and has the very best vitamins and minerals that your body loves??? In the produce section...all of those wonderfully colourful fruit and vegetables are all living things.

There are many vitamins and minerals that we need to eat because the body can’t make these things itself. Every food has different amounts of different vitamins and minerals, so it is hard to remember which food have which vitamins in them. It is important to eat a variety of fresh foods to make sure you are giving your body everything it needs.

I have said it so many times, but the body is amazing! One thing it does well, is it can pretend for a long time that it is healthy, even if it is missing some vitamins and minerals that it needs. While it pretends like nothing is wrong, it will give you little clues that something is missing, you just need to listen well to what it is saying.

If you feel tired, you might be low on the mineral iron, or a B vitamin. Some foods that have these vitamins and minerals? Eggs, spinach, mushrooms, olives.

Maybe you are catching every cold that is going around. This is a hint that your immune system needs a boost of vitamin A. Where from? Sweet potatoes, carrots, spinach. Or maybe it is missing some vitamin C, which we can get from capsicums, kiwi fruits, oranges, broccoli.

Have you been needing lots of fillings in your teeth, or have had a couple of fractured bones? Your body might be telling you it’s missing vitamin D which can be found in milk and cheese, spinach, nuts, and beans.

These are just a few example of hints from your body. Remember: hints can mean your body is pretending to be healthy. If we don’t pay attention to the not-so-serious hints, like being tired, then eventually, the hints can develop into more serious illnesses and we can become very sick.

The very best thing we can do for our bodies to make sure we give it all the vitamins and minerals it needs, is to eat as many different types of fruits and vegetables as we can, everyday and even at every meal time. If we do this, and if we really listen well to what our bodies are telling us, then we will be able to live a life full of energy!
