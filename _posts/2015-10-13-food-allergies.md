Food allergies are frustrating at best, and life threatening at worst.


An allergy occurs when the body responds inappropriately to a protein in certain foods that is has identified as being foreign and harmful to the body. When the body identifies something as foreign, the immune system kicks in and tries to rid the body of it.

For the most part, people have a sound understanding of severe food allergies and the symptoms that can occur (anaphylaxis), even if they do not have immediate personal experience with them. Less severe reactions are also common but have less awareness and are harder to recognise. Symptoms of a mild food allergy in children can include colic, reflux, gastrointestinal upset, failure to thrive.

Food allergies in children are becoming more and more common. The statistics show that hospital admission due to severe allergic reactions have doubled over the last decade in Australia, the UK, and the USA. This number is not just a record of people presenting to hospitals, but hospital admissions ie. admission post assessment by a physician. Peanut allergies especially, have increased dramatically.

There is no cure for food allergies, avoidance of the trigger foods is the only way to prevent a reaction. In the school environment, avoidance is not always possible, however education and awareness is an absolute must in order to protect the child with food allergies. Children in the class should be aware of trigger foods, and everyone should be cautioned against sharing any foods, in case of cross contamination. The seriousness of a possible reaction really needs to be emphasised for the school community.

If someone has a suspected food allergy, and symptoms involve airways and breathing, or they are experiencing coughing or wheezing, emergency help must be called immediately (911/000).

There are a few theories as to why the number of children experiencing food allergies are increasing so dramatically. Some include:

Delayed versus early introduction of high allergen foods.
Introduction of different (foreign) proteins into our foods to protect from pesticides.
Different preparation and processing of foods, roasted peanuts are more allergenic
The Western diet's effect on the gut biome
Food allergies are a topic that will see a lot more research in the near future. There aren't many definitive answers currently, but there are many experts and institutes with a keen interest of working out the culprits to the increase incidence, and also discovering a cure.

For now, avoidance is the safest option.
