Physical

Menta

Emotional

The health of any human being, child or adult, must be looked at in a holistic way. Physical,

mental and emotional health hold equal importance for the health of the whole, and they must

all be in balance to achieve optimal health.

To know that all three categories work as one and are dependant on each other, think of the last

time you had a bad flu or stomach bug, you were physically very sick, but were you feeling

happy at the same time? From my own experience, no you weren’t, you felt miserable, you

couldn’t think straight, and like you could cry for days. Your physical state also affected your

mental and emotional state also. Think of the last time you had your heart broken. Was it just

your emotional state affected? No, you probably felt physically sick, didn’t want to eat(or maybe

you wanted to eat everything in sight), and I dare say you didn’t make you’re best decisions at

that time either.

Everything is connected!!

But having said that, I am going to break it down, and because I find our physical state the

easiest to understand, that is where I’m going to start. And, I’m going to break that down a little

too!! And what better place to start, that at the top?

For The Kids

Hiding safe behind our eyes, nose, mouth and hair, inside our skulls, is our own personal

computer that helps us walk, talk, breath, think, love and sleep. The brain helps us do

everything! Messages are continuously being sent to the brain from the body, and the brain is

always talking back to your body, letting it know just what to do.

● The front of the brain: This part helps you plan out your actions, helps you pay attention,

and helps you feel emotions like happiness and sadness.

● The Top of the Brain: This part helps you feel things, and know what shape they are,

how warm or cool they are and if something is too hot, like the water in you brain, it

helps pull your hand away, and protect you from any burns.

● The Sides of the Brain: This part helps you hear, and memorise things that you hear. It is

also the part of the brain that helps you learn new things and remember new people who

you meet.

● The Back of the Brain: This part helps the eyes to know what they are seeing, different

shapes, colours, sizes, and if something is close or far away from us.

The brain has different sections, but it is so brilliant at talking together as one that we don’t even

know which part is working as we go through each day and do the things we love to do.

Sometime, if someone hurts a part of their brain, if they are in an accident or they get sick, one

of these sections of the brain might be affected. So if you look at what each part controls, you

might know which part isn’t working so well. Has someone lost some of their memory? Is

someone having trouble planning out what they need to do? Is someone having trouble learning

new things? With the brain being responsible for so many things, it is easy to see how in some

people, sometimes something doesn’t quite work properly!

How do we keep the brain healthy?

The brain loves water!! So drink up!

The brain loves fruits and vegetables and all the good things they offer, so make sure your plate

is full of colourful fruits and vegetables.

The brain loves healthy fats and actually, it is mostly made up of fat, so it doesn’t just love it, it

NEEDS it

The brain loves to practice. It love when you try new things because it gets to practice new ways

of doing things

The brain loves to sleep. It works so hard, when you sleep it gets some well deserved rest and

prepares for tomorrow.

The brain loves to stay clean. It loves when you get outside and get fresh air!

For Parents

The best way for kids to learn is to do and to see. Choose some fun activities that use the

different lobes of the brain. Talk about which part is working while they are being creative

(painting, dancing, storytelling), and which is working when they are exploring critical thinking

(planning things out, learning new words, or reasoning).

Children are so inquisitive, they love to look at others and look at themselves, and see

how people differ. This is great and an essential part of growing up. We can get trapped

into comparisons however, and this can be detrimental later in life. Making clear

distinction between how someone looks and how they act and which is important is vital

when working with kids. A little exercise to do is to break down every feature on the face

and determine what each is used for and how it is vital for the child. How the eyes see,

nose smells, mouth communicates, teeth chew. By really understanding how each

feature works, we lose the fixation on how the features look.

The Heart

Out of all the muscles in the body, I’d say the heart is up there with the most important! Just the

size of your fist, but works so hard and gets so much done. It doesn’t ever, for your whole life,

take so much as a morning tea break! And it does all it needs to do without us even asking. How

incredible!

And, what does the heart actually do?

The human body is filled with blood. This blood carries the air we breathe and the nutrients from

the foods we eat, and delivers it to the body. Without the heart, the blood would just sit in our

blood vessels and it wouldn’t be able to move. The heart is one big pump that squeezes the

blood in and out and ensures it reaches all the way down to our toes.

When you sit still you may be able to feel your heart beating in your chest. Each minute, your

heart beats around 70 times, and each time it beats it is pumping that healthy blood around the

body. Each day, your heart pumps around 7200L of blood!! Think about the 2L jug of milk in

your fridge...your hearts pumps about 3600 of those jugs, every.single.day!!

Even though the heart does so much without even needing to be asked, it is great if we do all

that we can to make the heart’s job easier, that way it will continue to work well for you even

when you grow older.

● Drink lots of water. Which is easier, drinking water through a straw, or drinking honey

through a straw? The more water you drink, the easier it is for the blood to pump through

your heart through the blood vessels...no danger of clogging!

● When you exercise your muscles, remember you will be exercising your heart as well. It

can get boring pumping at the same speed day in and day out, your heart likes to mix

things up. Jump up and down for a few minutes and just listen to what your heart does!

You can tell that it gets excited when you’re moving because it starts to pump excitedly

fast.

● Your heart loves all the colours of the rainbow and the best way for it to see the colours,

is for you to eat them. Fill up that plate with as many fruits and vegetables as you can,

the more colourful your plate, the happier your heart will be.

Parents

One of the biggest stressors we can place on our hearts is to be in a constant state of stress,

but this is so common in today’s world. We have the fight or flight response for a reason and it

sets off an effective release of hormones and chemicals, through the body that help us think and

act quickly to get us out of danger. Chronic stress occurs when our lives are so busy that we are

constantly in a state of stress and we constantly have increased levels of excitatory hormones,

that are actually only meant for life and death situations. We so often get to adulthood and we

don’t have a single tool or technique to deal with stress.

Your kids will have to deal with stress when they are older, but working with them early to learn

relaxation techniques will give them a great head start for the future. The heartbeat is a great

tool for discovering relaxation. Have your children increase their heart rate by doing something

they like, then have them sit and really concentrate on the beat of their heart. Just have them

sitting still and quiet until the heart beat is back to it’s resting rhythm. It doesn’t take too long but

it can be quite a powerful exercise.

Lungs

If the heart is the most important muscle in the body, I’d say the lungs are pretty close to the top

of the list of important organs in the body. And just as the heart works not stop for us for our

whole lives, so do the lungs, and most of the time we don’t even know they are working.

We have 2 lungs that sit nicely protected before our sturdy ribs. The lungs draw in the air

through the nose and pull out the oxygen to give to the blood, to deliver around the body. The

lungs also allow us to breathe out unnecessary air that the body doesn’t need.

Whether you’re sleeping, eating, reading, relaxing, or playing sport, your lungs are ALWAYS

breathing and it’s really only when we stop and think about it, that we know that they are doing

it.

Every day we breathe around 22 000 times, but there are certain things that can speed up or

slow down our breath. When we play sport, or run up a hill, we need to get more oxygen to our

muscles, our lungs know this, so they speed up our breathing. When we sleep, our muscles

aren’t doing much, so our lungs slow down. Sometimes, if we are scared, or nervous, we will

hold our breath without even knowing it.

Just like the heart and the brain, our lungs do so much for us, that we really need to look after

them. The lungs will work best if they are given lots of exercise, lots of fruits and vegetable, and

plenty of fresh clean air and water.

What about when things go wrong?

You may have friends who have told you they have asthma, but what’s that? Asthma is a

condition that affects the lungs and breathing. There are many different reasons why someone

might experience asthma

● Dust in the air

● Flowers or grass

● Exercise

● Even just cold weather

and when they breath in air with one of these triggers, the airways from the nose to the lungs

swell up, meaning it is very hard to get air into the lungs, or for some, they have trouble getting

air out of the lungs.

If someone is having an asthma attack they may begin to cough, they may complain of chest

pains, they may tell you it is hard for them to breathe. But, because they lungs help us talk, if

someone is having a very bad asthma attack, they may not be able to tell you anything at all.

Stay calm, and find an adult. If your friend has had asthma before, they probably have

medication that they breathe in, that will help relax the airways and help them breathe. If they

haven’t had asthma before, they will be taken to a nurse or a doctor where they will get some

medication and maybe some extra oxygen to help the lungs out a little. It is important to

remember to remain calm and to find help immediately...your friend will thank you later. once

they are feeling better.

Stomach

The body uses the digestive system to get all the good things it needs from the foods we eat.

It’s easy to think that food only gets digested in the stomach, but in reality, the digestive system

includes almost everything the food touches! From the mouth, right up until we get rid of the

waste when we go to the toilet.

Parents

Trying to work out what is best your child can be a frustrating and endless search. The internet

is amazing, and if you know where to look, you will find reliable information that you can trust in

using with your child. The only issue is, it seems there is an infinite amount of information that

you need to sift for. If you find an article that lists something as a ‘healthy­must do’ for your

child, I can guarantee that with the right search you will be able to find a different expert who

appears to have great research, saying the complete opposite ‘unhealthy­avoid’.

Working out what is best for the child’s digestive system is no different, and there is a growing

body of research showing just how significantly important our gut is for overall health, physical

and now mental health.

Muscles

Every time you walk. talk, sleep, breathe, jump, sneeze, or smile, your muscles are working!

● You have around 640 muscles in your body

● There is a little debate about which is THE strongest, but your two strongest muscles are

one found on the outside of the eye, and one in your tongue!

● There actually 8 muscles in your tongue, that’s how we can chew up things like toffee.

● It takes 17 muscles to smile, but 43 muscles to frown. So. Always smile :)

● The heart is a muscle, but it is made up differently than the muscles in your arms or legs.

● Muscles have great memories! That’s how we get better at sports, our muscles start to

remember what to do and we don’t have to think about it so much. Or, if someone

passes you a box that you think will be heavy, but it’s actually very light, your arms will

spring upwards.

● Your muscles are made of lots and lots of tiny hair like ‘fibres’, muscles fibres. When we

need to move, the brain sends a signal to the muscles fibres to shorten or lengthen,

depending on the movement. If you move your foot towards your bottom, the muscles in

the back of your leg is shortening, while the muscles on the front of your leg, are

lengthening.

● When we are born, we are born with all the muscles fibres we will ever have. When we

play sports and ‘build’ muscle, we are are building the thickness of the muscle fibres, not

the number of fibres.

● Over your lifetime, your heart is the muscle that does the most work, it never stops

pumping.

Muscles are incredible, they let us do everything we can do. Sometimes we need to think about

moving a muscle, like when we decide to flex the bicep, and sometimes the muscles just do

their jobs without being asked, like the heart beating, or the muscles in our bladders. It is

important to remember that what is good for our muscles that we can see (our arm and leg

muscles) is equally as good for the heart muscles. This is why it is so important to eat well and

to exercise. Exercising also means that we will be able to move how we want to, when we get

older.

Bones

All of the pulling, tensing, and flexing we spoke about yesterday with muscles, is all done in

order to help move our bones around.

Bones help us stand up straight, they help protect our vital organs, like the skull for the brain, or

the ribs for the lungs and heart.

Our bones are living! They are constantly remodelling themselves, renewing and reshaping. If a

bone is broken, it can heal itself, but to make sure it heals in a straight line, a doctor will often

place a cast around the broken bone for extra support.

The biggest bone is the femur, the big bone in your thigh. The smallest bone in the body is

inside the ear.

An adult has 206 bones in the body. When we are born, some of these bones are in number of

different parts, and as we grow, the bones fuse together. Some children experience some

discomfort as these bones shift and start to fuse together, we often refer to this discomfort as

growing pain.

Healthy bones through the teenage years can mean excellent bone health in later life. Calcium

is one of the most important vitamins for bone help, and luckily it is easy to find in milk, yoghurt,

cheese, and dark green leafy vegetables.

Exercise is also very important for healthy bones

definitely

Immune System

I hope everyone is starting to understand just how amazing the body is, and how much cool

stuff goes in inside without us even knowing. To protect all these amazing processes from

illnesses and infections, we have our own little army that fights for us, the immune system.

Sometimes, things are working so well in the body, that it looks like a really great place to live,

even to germs and bacteria. But if germs decide that they want to move into the body, they can

distract your cells from doing their jobs and things can start wrong, that’s when we get sick.

Luckily, the immune system (specifically, cells called white blood cells) is on the lookout for

these imposters, and if they see them trying to move on in, they put up barriers and fight them

until they are gone.

If you have a fever, or a running nose and cough, or if you get a splinter your finger might feel

hot and look red, it is easy to assume that you are sick, but these symptoms (along with many

others) are all signs that your immune system is doing it’s job.

● A fever is your body’s way of heating up the body so that the germs get too hot and don’t

want to live there any more.

● A running nose means that we will blow our nose and any germs that caught up will be

blown away into a tissue.

● The redness and swelling around a splinter means your immune system has sent its

troops to your finger to push the splinter out.

Your lungs and intestines have special cells in their linings which produce a sticky mucous. This

mucous is a part of the immune defense because it traps any germs that get into the body, and

prevents them from getting into the blood and causing any damage.

Another line of defense is the acid that your stomach produces, It’s not until the germs get in

their that they realise they really don’t want to live somewhere so acidic, so they find their own

way out.

Unfortunately, sometimes germs can get through our defense system and we can get sick. Our

immune system can get tired, just like we do, so there are a few things we can do to help it out

● Eat lots of fresh fruits and vegetables, and keep sugary snacks to a minimum.

● Play lots of sports! A strong healthy body = a strong and healthy immune system

● Hand hygiene is extremely important. It not only protects us, but it also protects our

friends and families, not everyone is lucky enough to have a great immune system

● Get lots of rest. When you sleep, your immune system can rest too and it will be ready to

fight for you tomorrow.

●  Vitamin D that we get when we go out in the sun is very helpful to our immune system.

It is important to be sun safe, but to also allow ourselves a few rays of sunshine.

Isn’t it great to know you have your own army working away inside your body??? We are more

like superheros than we know!

Nutrition

If you’ve read my previous post in this series, you may just wonder why I go on and on about

eating colouful fruits and vegetables everyday. I think I have mentioned at least once in every

single post. It’s not just that I love to repeat myself, it just so happens that every single part of

the body gains so much when we eat these foods.

We are so incredibly lucky to have SO much choice when we set foot in a grocery store. With

aisle after aisle filled with foods, snacks, drinks, desserts, it is easy to forget that not everything

on offer is actually beneficial for the body.

A good trick to use when thinking about what your body needs and loves, is to remember that

every cell in your body is alive, and needs living energy to survive. The very best place to find

this living energy is from fruits and vegetables because they are also living. It sounds a bit

strange to say that an apple is living, I know, but if you’ve ever forgotten about an apple in the

bottom of your school bag, and found it a few weeks later, you will understand that that apple is

no longer living!!

When you eat something, your body breaks breaks it down into its tiniest particles, either

macronutrients or micronutrients

● Macronutrients

● Micronutrients

­ Vitamins, minerals, phytochemicals and antioxidants

Different foods are made up of different combinations of these two categories. Every time

something important happens in your body: your heart beats, your brain thinks or makes

decisions, or your hair grows, the cells in your body are using vitamins and minerals to fuel the

actions. Your body make

INTRO TO NUTRITION

Nutrition is a topic that causes so much debate. We all need to eat, yet no one, not even experts

in the field can agree on a way of eating that is best for everyone. We are incredibly lucky to

have such a huge selection when we go to the grocery store or fresh food markets, and as

ungrateful as I know it sounds, this choice can just make it harder to decide on what’s best. Big

food companies are all too aware of this, and they pay the big bucks for marketers to prepare

their items with the decision fatigued consumer in mind ie. no matter the nutritional value, make

this product as appealing and easy for the customer.

Easy is good, but easy is not serving our society well. The number of nutrition related chronic

diseases is at an all time high and continues to grow. Chronic diseases that in the past were

saved for adults who had hounded their bodies for years with poor choices are now showing up

in the younger generation, and the ramifications of this will be shocking when they surface in the

future. It is no wonder however that children have trouble knowing how best to fuel their bodies

when us adults are having such a hard time figuring it out as well. It is hard to conduct great

research on nutritional habits because the science always ends up to be reductionist science,

one thing is good or one thing is bad, when in reality a meal is a meal and generally includes a

range of different foods. It is hard to tell where we are going wrong.

­ Carbohydrates, fats, and proteins

No matter what other recommendations experts and health professionals provide for the public,

there is one piece of advice I think everyone agrees on. Eat more fruits and vegetables!!

Whether someone chooses to include or avoid things like meat. fish, dairy, grains, or legumes,

we should first and foremost be eating as many fruits and vegetables as we can. And just my 2

cents worth, though I’m sure there still isn’t 100% agreement on this just yet, we should be

avoiding added sugars and processed foods wherever we can.

Leading by example is the very best way to encourage children to eat in a way that is beneficial

for the body. Some patterns of change are starting to take place in select schools and

corporations, however there is a huge road ahead for making a blanket change, I’m thinking

hospital foods, fundraising efforts which are always associated with selling biscuits and lollies.

and the huge amount of junk that is still offered in most school canteens. If you can instill good

decision making and educate your children around nutrition in the home, they will at least have

an advantage when faced with these poor choices on offer when they set foot outside the home.

I wrote a blog over on BodyKinect in which I talk about the importance of language around diets

and our learned behaviour of labelling foods as good and bad, and how I think this is a horrible

habit we’ve all adopted. How we talk about food as adults is being picked up by the little ears

around us, so it is vital that we are aware of how we are acting.

Nutrition Basics

While the body is alive, it is using energy, for every little thing it does. Every organ, and every

system in the body needs energy to survive, and it gets this energy from food. It is hard to

imagine how an apple can provide energy, but the body works its magic to pull all of the energy

out of the apple. Everytime we eat, it is like we are recharging our batteries.

The digestive tract, that we talked about here, starts with the mouth, and it break down the food

into tiny particles. These particles are shipped off to different parts of the body that need them

the most, and they are turned into energy!

The 3 main groups that our foods are broken into by digestion are:

● Carbohydrates

­ Carbohydrates can be quickly used by the body for energy

­ They are broken down into glucose, which is a type of sugar

­ If we eat more carbs than the body can use, we store the extra as fat ­ Fruits and vegetables have excellent amounts of carbohydrates in them, for our

bodies to use

● Proteins

­ Proteins are found in foods like eggs, meats, dairy, legumes

­ Proteins are broken down into amino acids which are used to build and repair muscles

­ Protein is the main part of mostly all the cells in the body

­ Proteins take longer for the body to digest than carbohydrates.

● Fats

­ Fats can be found in many food items like: eggs, avocado, fish, cheese, meat ­ The body needs fat for growth and it uses it as energy. ­ The body is slow at breaking down fats

­ Your brain is mainly made up of fats, so for a healthy brain we need to consume healthy

fats

Different foods have different amounts of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats, so different foods

will give you different amounts of energy at different times

    ● Micronutrients

­ Vitamins

­ Minerals

­ Antioxidants

Yesterday we talked about energy, but where does that energy go? Sometimes it’s easier to

notice when we don’t have energy, than when we do, but maybe you’ve felt after eating a nice

healthy meal for lunch, that it’s easier to play sport in the afternoon, because you have lots of

energy.

As well as playing sport however, lots of energy goes into growing, staying healthy, and fixing

any parts of the body that may be damaged. These things take energy, and they also require

vitamins and minerals. Vitamins and minerals are tiny particles found in the fresh foods that we

eat.

Since vitamins and minerals are used in the body for things like growing, and keeping our cells

alive, the body LOVES to get these vitamins and minerals from other living things, because they

already know how to do a great job! So, what can you find at the grocery store that is living and

has the very best vitamins and minerals that your body loves??? In the produce section...all of

those wonderfully colourful fruit and vegetables are just that colourful because they are living.

There are many vitamins and minerals that we need to eat because the body can’t make these

things itself, and it is hard to remember which food have which vitamins in them, so it is

important to eat a variety of fresh foods so make sure you are giving your body everything it

needs.

I have said it so many times, but the body is amazing! One thing it does well, is it can pretend

for a long time that it is healthy, even if it is missing some vitamins and minerals that it needs. It

will however give you clues that something is missing, you just need to listen well to what it is

saying.

● If you feel tired, you might be low on the mineral iron, or a B vitamin.

­Some foods that have these vitamins and minerals? Eggs, spinach, mushrooms, olives

● Maybe you are catching every cold that is going around. This is a hint that your immune

system needs a boost of vitamin A. Where from? Sweet potatoes, carrots, spinach.

Or vitamin C, from capsicums, kiwi fruits, oranges, broccoli.

● Another hint your body can give you is if you are needing lots of fillings in your teeth, or if

you have had a couple of fractured bones. Your body is telling you it’s missing vitamin D

which can be found in milk and cheese, spinach, nuts, and beans.

These are just a few example of hints from your body, and hints means that the body is

pretending to be healthy. If we don’t pay attention to the not­so­serious hints like being tired,

then eventually, the hints can develop into more serious illnesses and we can become very sick.

The very best thing we can do for our body, to make sure we give it all the vitamins and

minerals it needs, is to eat as many different types of fruits and vegetables as we can, everyday

and even every meal time. If we do this, and if we really listen well to what our bodies are telling

us, then we will be able to live a life full of energy!

anaphylaxis

Allergies

Food allergies are frustrating at best, and life threatening at worst.

The most common allergy trigger foods are:

● cow’s milk

● eggs

● peanuts

● tree nuts

● seeds

● seafood

An allergy occurs when the immune system responds inappropriately to a protein in certain

foods that is has identified as being foreign and harmful to the body.

People are becoming more aware of the growing number of severe, anaphylactic responses to

food allergies, but less severe reactions are also common and harder to recognise. Symptoms

of a mild food allergy in children can include colic, reflux, gastrointestinal upset, failure to thrive.

Food allergies are becoming more common in recent times. The statistics suggest more than

just a rise in a awareness of food allergies as hospital admission due to severe allergic

reactions have doubled over the last decade in Australia, the UK, and the USA. These numbers

are not only increased hospital presentations by parents, but hospital admission, which occur

after a doctor’s assessment.

There is no cure for food allergies, avoidance of the trigger foods is the only way to prevent a

reaction. In the school environment, avoidance is not always possible, however education and

awareness is a must to protect the child with food allergies. Children in the class should be

aware of trigger foods, and everyone should be cautioned against sharing any foods, in case of

cross contamination. The seriousness of a possible reaction, really needs to be emphasised for

the school community.

If someone has a suspected food allergy, and symptoms involve airways and breathing, or they

are experiencing  coughing or wheezing, emergency help must be called immediately (911/000)

FARE is a great resource for information and education on all things allergies!

There are a few theories as to why the number of children experiencing food allergies are

increasing so dramatically. Some include

● Delayed versus early introduction of high allergen foods.

● Introduction of different (foreign) proteins into our foods to protect from pesticides.

● Different preparation and processing of foods, roasted peanuts are more allergenic

● The Western diet’s effect on the gut biome

A Healthy Relationship With Food

A healthy relationship with food goes way beyond whether someone is a picky eater. It is about

knowledge of food and maybe more importantly, knowledge of the body, it is about respect for

both the body and for where food is coming from. It is also about awareness of all the decisions

we can make about food, and all of the decisions we think we are making but that are being

made for us, unwittingly.

● Know the food ­ A little understanding of what food is made up of, and what it is

delivering to the body goes a long way. Know that fresh and from nature is always best.

● Know and respect the body ­ When we know what the body wants, it is easier to make

decision about what to give it. If we know how the body responds to certain foods, how

they make us feel and how they make us move, then we will naturally want to fill up first

on what the body needs. What can be helpful for some (adults and children) is to keep a

food journal. Ensure you steer clear of calories in the journal, keep it for energy levels,

overall feeling of wellness, and any indications that the body isn’t loving a certain food. It

is a great way to get to know the body. ­ Playing sport and knowing how food can affect performance is also great for children.

● Be aware of decision making around food ­ There are so many factors that can influence

our decision when it comes to what we choose to eat. Knowledge of what the body

loves, hormones, how rested we are, food advertising, society’s (unhelpful) language

around food: good/bad/cheat/treat/diet...

Day 15

We are halfway through this crazy challenge, write every day for the month of October.

Time to reflect on the first half and plan for a better second half.

Maybe I’ve taken on more of a mammoth task than I first assumed. I am, indeed writing every

day, but I wish I could write more. I guess that’s the beauty of this platform, there is always an

edit button. So, while I may have committed to 31 days of writing, I may have unknowingly

committed to an eternity of editing for this series, but that is fine.

The more I read, the more my love for the human body grows. Whether I am reading facts for

kids or more scientific, research based articles I am intrigued with what is going on inside and

I’m even more curious and excited for the discoveries that I am certain are not far away.

My only hope for this little challenge series is to spread some of this excitement and curiosity

about the human body, all of its amazing features, known and unknown.

As with most things in life, the more we know about it, the more we can choose to respect it.

Exercise

The benefits of exercise have been known forever, in one way or another. Back in the good ol’

days, maybe the physiology of exercise was not understood, or even contemplated, but people

knew that to survive, they needed to be strong, be able to run, hunt, fight. If they didn’t do it,

they knew they’d lose it, which ultimately meant, death.

Now, we know an incredible amount about exercise physiology, how it works, and how much

the body needs exercise to stay functional. Even though we very much still need to be

physically active to survive, this is no longer the way we see it! We see exercise as a chore

we’ve been told we need to do by a cranky old high school gym teacher. Exercise can feel hard,

so in an age where every single thing in our lives is designed to make our lives easier,

something hard doesn’t see itself on the top of our priority list. Unfortunately, this whole scenario

of easy, inactive living may mean we all get a really easy, really short life.

So what do we know are the benefits of exercise?

­ heart health

­ weight control, which leads to a whole list in itself of disease prevention

­ strengthening of bones and muscles, which increases functionality later in life

­ brain health, focused thinking and increased learning

­ improvements in mental health and feelings of wellbeing

­ ability to run for the bus (you don’t see that one in the textbooks, but hey, why not?)

Not only is exercise great for disease prevention, or treatment of disease... but it just improves

quality of life ten­fold, and it is hard to imagine how good the body is designed to feel until you

feel it. We get so used to the puffing walking up stairs, or the sore legs from a day shopping, or

not being fast enough to run for the bus, that we start to think it’s just normal, it’s how everyone

feels! But it shouldn’t be.

We constantly hear how much a toddler can run around and how fast they are, always on the go

go go. I wonder when they make the switch from the naturally physically active child, to the child

who has no desire to get up from the computer screen. Most likely when they start school and

are asked to sit behind a desk for 6+hrs a day and concentrate. Tomorrow I will write a bit more

about the connection between exercise and the learning brain.

Like anything else, leading by example is key. Being an active child is a whole lot easier in an

active family. While children are young they should, where possible, be exposed to as big a

variety of sports and activities as they can be. Trying one sport and not loving it, does not mean

that a child is not ‘the active type’, it means they haven’t found something that works for them. ­ Team sports

­ Individual sports

­ Endurance

­ Sprint ­ Adventure

­ Relaxation

­ Competitive

­ Progressive

­ Repetitive

The list could go on!

Sports can be such a great way of tying healthy living together as we get to see progression, we

learn the limits of the body and then we get to smash through those limits, in time.

Shouldn’t be called exercise, or negative connotation around exercise being hard need to

disappear.

Everything in life is getting easier, transport, foods, remotes, learning, which is great, but we will

have a really easy, short life. What is the point? We are made to exercise. We used to do it to

survive, now we do it because someone behind a computer is telling us we need to do it.

So many different forms of physical activity. Games. Need to be careful the message certain

sports send. I did gymnastics, and can specifically remember in grade 9 being given a sheet of

exercises that we were to do to help us fit into size 8 jeans. What about the benefits of the

exercises? How they will make the routines easier, help us think straigh

Exercise and the learning brain

Exercise and physical activity is known to be fundamentally important for physical health and

disease prevention for every single person in the community! We KNOW it, and there are

hundreds/thousands of well designed studies of all different sizes, on all different age groups to

support this statement. So why, then, from the age of 5 (sometimes younger) do we sit at desks

for hours a day, for some, for the rest of our lives?

Besides the myriad of physical health issues this may be causing, there is new research coming

to light that suggests that inactivity in the class has a direct relationship with learning difficulties

of varying severities in children. When I heard that there are schools in the US cutting back on,

or removing altogether, physical education from the school curriculum, it was pretty shocking. I

could naively assume that something like that would never happen in Australia, but the truth is,

it’s probably not that unlikely.

Instead of being removed, the time dedicated to physical activity, or strenuous play, should be

increasing, and children should be up and moving several times throughout the day, not once or

twice through the week.

So how does exercise affect the learning brain?

Increased blood flow by increasing the heart rate with exercise, also means increased blood

flow to and through the brain.

There is some research to suggest that exercise actually creates new brains cells within the

Hippocampus of the brain. This is the section of the brain responsible for learning and memory.

Improved attention span has been correlated to increased physical activity.

Exercise is thought to improve the brain’s neuroplasticity, which essentially means the brains is

more malleable and forms connections more efficiently ie. better learning.

Exercise can reduce stress and anxiety, which are two big barriers to learning in the classroom.

Mental Health

I think we are so in denial about the general state of mental health at the moment. So much so

that we can’t even put an appropriate name to it. We talk about mental health when in fact we

are referring to mental illness. We don’t ever refer to someone who is physically ill as someone

who suffers from physical health problems Why are we too afraid to say that someone is sick,

when we can go so far at to put someone on a pedestal if they have a physical illness, or if

someone recovers from a physical illness? We rush to support someone who is unwell

(physically) cook food, offer to do the grocery shopping, or look after children, we visit someone

in the hospital, or if someone is feeling unwell in the workplace, where possible, we would

happily tell them to get home and rest up.

Yet when it comes to thinking and the well being of the mind, we shy away from it. Maybe we

know someone who is struggling, but it’s hard to know what to say, let alone offer practical

support. If someone is feeling mentally unwell in the workplace, it would be extremely rare that

they would be offered an early mark and told to rest up. We still use terms like ‘crazy person’ to

describe someone who has acted in a way we see as inappropriate, or that something is ‘all in

their head’, when really, there is more going on in the head than we will ever know! This stigma

attached to our feelings of mental health problems may stem from back in the day when

someone who was mentally unwell was assumed to have been affected by evil spirits...if we are

holding on to these beliefs, still, then we undoubtedly need to shift our thinking.

‘Mental Health’ is defined as  ‘a state of well­being in which the individual realizes his or her own

abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to

make a contribution to his or her community’. It involves our emotional, psychological and social

well­being. It is our ability to respond appropriately to everyday life, and determines how we

think, feel, and act.

If it is so hard for adults to deal with and respect, then it is a topic that will cause difficulty for

children if there is a need to approach it. It is already so hard for children to adapt to growing up,

that an illness that can affect thoughts, feelings, and actions does not make it easier.

Common Mental Health Issues in Children

Anxiety and depression are the most common disorders in children and adolescents.

The causes for these disorders are multifaceted but malnutrition has been linked to both anxiety

and depression. Unlike the common misconception, malnutrition can result from being

underweight, but more so for the western society, being overweight. We have a surplus of

calories and a deficit of nutrients. The digestion of nutritions we do take in may even be inhibited

by the processed highly refined aspects of our diets.

How nutrition, or lack thereof affect mental health?

The comprehensive report Feeding Minds: The Impact of Food On Mental Health compiles the

major current research on nutrition and mental health. It is extremely easy to read and I

encourage you to do so. Some of the take home points:

● The brain is directly affected by what we eat and drink

● Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers in the brain and are an integral part in

controlling our thoughts, feelings (of contentment), and cognitive efficiency.

● Some processed foods mimic these neurotransmitters, tricking the body into down-
regulating, and falsely altering healthy brain function.

● Since the body is being tricked, it stops sending signals to seek the whole foods that it

actually needs for normal brain function.

● There is increased likelihood of developing depression if the body is deficient in nutrients

such as: folic acid, omega 3 fatty­acids, selenium, and tryptophan.

● There are correlations between low intake of fatty fish  and depression.

● 60% of the dry weight of the brain is made up of fat. 20% of these fats are essential fatty

acids, meaning the body can’t make them, we must eat them, omega 3 and omega 6.

● It is believed that to keep the functional ratio of omega3 and omega 6 in the brain, we

must eat them in equal quantities, however the western diet is very high in omega 6 and

low in omega 3.

● Trans fats, found readily in the western diet, take place in the brain where the essential

fatty acids should be. Trans fats have a different structure however, they are rigid, and

interfere with the transmission of neurotransmitters. In turn, this alters our thoughts,

feelings, and moods.

Sound nutrition is vital when it comes to our mental health!

I appreciate the fact that other causes may be involved in the development of mental illnesses,

but for a child’s growing brain, good nutrition is a no brainer. If not for treatment of illness, then

nutrition needs to be used as protective tools for our children. We are privileged to have choice,

we are spoilt for information from research studies that have been performed and interpreted for

us. We just have to do it!

Each plate to be primarily filled with a wide variety of vegetables, fruits, legumes, and a

significant reduction in processed, highly refined foods and drinks.

Exercise and Depression

Exercise may be an underutilised treatment for depression and anxiety.

While other forms of treatment for depression like medications, can be effective, they can also

have some nasty side­effects. Exercise may be a suitable substitute for antidepressant

medications

Exercise is known to increase the circulation and effectiveness of endorphins through the body.

Endorphins are responsible for mood, they also decrease our perception of pain, and enhance

our immunity.Exercise is also known to stimulate the production of serotonin, which is

responsible for feelings of happiness, and feelings of security.

This study concludes that exercise can be as effective as pharmaceutical therapies and

cognitive behavioural therapies. Exercise has less, if any, side effects if done under the

supervision of an exercise physiologist or personal trainer. The only downside to using exercise

is the motivational barrier that some could experience.

Problems with motivation  are commonly associated with depression. We know that motivation

to exercise is tricky to obtain and maintain for anyone, so someone displaying depressive

tendencies may find exercise extra difficult

How much exercise is an appropriate dose? This is tricky to answer, as it is a hard study to

design as there are so many possible variables. One study concluded that high energy

expenditure exercise is required for optimal results of decreasing depressive symptoms. We

also know that activities like long distance running can be quite stressful on the body and they

can have have a detrimental effect on some bodies.

Certain types of exercise can also be extremely meditative. Exercise can help you focus solely

on your breath, or the movements of your body and for the time in which you spend exercising

you may be able to quiet the brain. Exercising is also a great way to have a break from

constantly being on the go which we are all prone to. It may be the one time in which you can

not be reached by phone, or the one time you don’t check an email as soon as you see the

notification pop up on your phone.

And what does this have to do with children?

Well, studies solely involving children, exercise, and depression are harder to find, but I don’t

think it would be wrong to assume that the beneficial effects of exercise span to children as well

as adults.

Depression and anxiety are becoming more common and are being diagnosed at an earlier age.

While many factors are involved, lifestyle must be one of the culprits. Exercise is a safe way of

treating symptoms, and increased physical activity could be an excellent way of preventing the

onset of depression. Exercise in children will strengthen them physically, and mentally, boost

self esteem, which is vital in younger years, and could improve sleep.

If we find a love for exercise as adults, and experience the many benefits, then it will be much

easier to be able to, and want to, encourage children to participate as well. Being physically

active as a family can set great foundations, and finding a type of exercise compatible with the

child is imperative.

Emotional Intelligence Intro

So, Emotional intelligence is not something you would usually see associated with a child’s

health. I think this may be the cause for many issues that can develop over the life span. I

believe emotional health is just as important as and is influential over both mental and physical

health.

Whats does emotional intelligence, or emotional health mean?

plucked straight from Wiki: “Emotional intelligence can be defined as the ability to monitor one's

own and other people's emotions, to discriminate between different emotions and label them

appropriately and to use emotional information to guide thinking and behavior.”  ­ Using emotions effectively

­ Identifying emotions properly

­ Regulating emotions successfully

Emotions fuel decisions. Everything we do in life is because of a decision we’ve made, eating,

cleaning, studying, working, working out. How we react to different situations both good and

bad, and how we react to and treat people is based on decisions stemming from emotions.

It would appear that some people have an innate calmness, a never wavering temper that sees

them through the toughest of situations with ease. For the rest of us, it maybe doesn’t come so

naturally.  And looking at the extreme end of the spectrum, people who are acting out, or acting

in a fundamentally unethical way, if looked at closely probably do not have any sort of a grasp

on their emotions or how to express them.There are a number of social issues that probably

stem from lack of emotional intelligence, yet I would say the majority of adults are still walking

around with subpar understanding of their emotions...I am definitely including myself in that list.

A few things that could be improved with emotional intelligence

● Academic performance

● Self­esteem

● Bullying

● Respect for others

● Empathy for others

● An understanding of, and respect for the world we live in

● A respect for ourselves, which in the long run could prevent many physical health

problems

● Mental health problems like anxiety and depression

● Overall feelings of happiness

From Miracle Child, to Lost in The Millions

From the minute a baby is conceived, it is an absolute miracle!

Everyone who hears the news of a pregnancy is delighted  and the news just brings such a

sense of joy! Of course, people are excited for the new parents, but the news of a baby also

makes people start reflecting on how incredible it is that two people can make a little human.

Every milestone a baby reaches, every millimeter they grow, someone tells that baby they are

amazing, beautiful, unique, and that they will be able to be whatever they desire when they grow

up, because they are just SO special!

As a baby grows into toddler, toddler to preschooler, and so on to teenage years, parents never

stop seeing, believing, and knowing the amazing, unique and miraculous qualities of that child.

So, when is it that we stop seeing, believing, and knowing these qualities in ourselves?? When

is the day we stop hearing people singing our praises? And why, after so many years of positive

and loving conditioning, do our brains decide to listen to and hold on to the one criticism we may

hear along the way?

I do not know the answer, these are just the things I wonder.

Introvert/extrovert

Growing up, I always thought I was so shy. I didn’t like to talk to people I didn’t know, sometimes

I’d say less to the people I did know. I would constantly have thoughts rushing through my head,

but very rarely would I share them.

If introduced to someone new, I was always so polite, and selective with words. It would take a

long time for my barriers to come down, and for my playful side to come out.

If I was in a situation where I was around lots of people, even if I knew them well, I would feel

fine for a short while, and then like a switch was flicked, I would feel the need to get out of the

room and sit quietly or just walk by myself.

On a number of occasions I did get comments (most likely by a very chatty person) on how I

didn’t say much, and it often had the connotation that this quality was in someway bad.

I always just thought I was shy, and slowly over time, I (incorrectly) started associating shy with

boring. I must be boring if I don’t care to say much.

Then one day on a quiet shift in the hospital, after working on a new ward for about 6 months, I

was chatting one on one with another nurse. I can’t remember now how we even got to it, but I

started talking about just how shy I was. She instantly Laughed Out Loud and shook her head

‘You are far from shy’ she said ‘I’ve seen you with everyone! You may be an introvert, but you’re

definitely not shy!’

I must have been at least 25 at the time. I prided myself on my ability to read others and thought

I was a very good judge of character, yet I’d made it a quarter century and didn’t have a clue

about the type of person that I was.

Characteristics of Introverts

● Reserved & reflective

● Enjoy solitude

● Dislike small talk, but enjoy one on one discussions about subjects of interest

● Dislike conflict

● Regain energy from being alone, while spending time with others can be extremely

draining

● Observational

● Like to work on one thing at a time and generally work best on our own

● We like people, just not all the time (this is so true and made me laugh to read!

Sometimes I have no explanation as to why I don’t want to see someone...sometimes I

need to mentally prepare)

Characteristics of Extroverts

● Enjoy human interaction

● Energized by spending time around others

● Work well in groups

● Like to take charge

● Prone to boredom

● Interested in the practical realities of life

● Spontaneous

● Love to meet new people and always looking for new interactions

● Encourage interaction amongst others

Ambiversion is when someone identifies with qualities in both the introvert and extrovert, depending

on the situation and environment.

As you can see, both lists of characteristics have incredible strengths. Issues can arise however,

when a situation doesn’t nurture the qualities of the personalities. For instance, if someone works

best on their own, it can be difficult to work efficiently when always asked to participate in group

assignments at school.

This incredibly popular TED talk by Susan Cain explains how difficult it can be to be an introvert in

today’s society, and how certain situations are not compatible with the introvert traits and we may be

stomping on people’s potential, just because as a society we misunderstand how introverts work.

I think it would be valuable for children to be introduced to these concepts early on. There are a vast

number of personality tests available that go into much more detail and are a lot more specific, but if

a child simply understands that there are two main personality types, that are fundamentally different

from each other but both possess great strengths, then it could be a great way for them to

understand themselves and others (who may be the complete opposite to them) in a respectful, non

judgemental way.

Did you understand these different personality traits growing up? Or was I just late to the self-
awareness party? I’d love to hear from you!!

Introducing Emotions to Children

“Anyone can be angry ­ that is easy, but to be angry with the right person, to the right degree, at the

right time, for the right purpose, and in the right way ­ that is not easy.”

Emotions are feelings we are constantly experiencing in everyday life. Everybody feels them, yet

most of us aren’t great at expressing them or understanding and responding to them.

If you think about other responses the body throws at us, it most cases, they are signaling us to do

something. If we neglect to listen to the message, the signals continue until taken care of. A painful

response is a signal to move your toe away from the hard object that you just kicked. The signal the

bladder sends to you that it is requiring an emptying, never goes away until you do something about

it. A signal of a sore stomach is your body telling you to stop eating a certain food.

Emotions are responses just like the physical ones. Yet, it is pretty common practice to avoid or

suppress emotions because we can perceive them as being potentially uncomfortable. But, needing

to pee is uncomfortable, and it isn’t a signal that will go away if we ignore it or distract ourselves by

doing other things, that nagging will remain, and intensify. The same thing happens with emotions.

Emotions don’t go away because we don’t want them. It is the mind’s way of responding to a

situation. The more you try to not think about it, the more the thoughts will pop into your head,

consuming space and energy that could be focused onto more productive things.

When dealing with emotional responses in children, it is important to remember that emotions

provide physiological responses within the body. A child in a fit of rage....not matter the cause...is

experiencing a rush of adrenaline causing an increased heart rate and other excitatory reactions.

Simply using the words ‘calm down’ will not lower the child heart heart and expel the increased

adrenaline from cursing through the veins.

At four years of age, a child will generally begin to show interest in others and start making

comparisons. This is the age where children start to recognise feelings, so even though it is great as

adults to model the emotional behaviour you wish to pass on to your child, starting from the moment

they are born, around the 4 year mark is when more specific and focused emotional coaching can

begin. Of course this is general, and you will know best when your child is ready to start these

activities, but whenever you start, it is best to focus just on your child’s own feelings.

● Start putting names to emotions. There are so many more emotions, than happy, sad, or

angry. Just within happy you could feel ecstatic, joy, contentment, thrilled, accomplished.

While these words may not be appropriate for a 4 year old, just point out that there are

different types of happiness/sadness.

● Have the child draw the face they might make when they are feeling certain ways. Or, use

pictures from magazines to show which face they might use to show the emotions.

● Once they have identified emotions, you can start exploring words that are associated with

the emotions, and words to use when feeling emotions.

There are so many great resources on sites like Pinterest to use when talking about emotions.

Different strategies will work for different children, so if at first you don’t strike interaction gold with

your child, have another look and see if there are resources with different looks and feels.

Regulating Emotions

So, just because I know to name my emotion anger, does not automatically mean that I know how to

appropriately express myself when the situation arises, and neither do children. But, emotional

expression is much more than anger management. It is about understanding and appreciating that

everyone will experience any number of emotions in any given situation, but that no emotion needs

to be overwhelming and does not need to interfere with life.

If you think of a situation where you’ve felt emotionally out of control, chances are that there was

some sort of frustration surrounding whatever other emotions you were feeling at time. Frustration

tends to exaggerate other feelings. When a child doesn’t have the words or means to express

themselves, their seemingly trivial daily activities can seem overwhelming.

Daily de­brief

Kenneth Barish, PhD, child therapist and clinical associate professor of psychology,  suggests that

taking time each day to talk through any bothersome feelings or to remember any troubling

situations from the day is a great way to encourage conversation around emotions and help to grow

the child’s emotional vocabulary. He also suggests that instead of trying to do such an activity when

the parent is stressed, tired, hungry, or preoccupied can tend to add to frustration and will be less

effective. So set aside a time of the day when you can take 5 minutes before to prepare. This may

very well be great mindfulness training for the overwhelmed parent as well.

Physical Responses

Building self­awareness of physical responses can be a great tool for future use. Have the child

really try and remember where in the body they felt changes when they were feeling their different

emotions.

Outside Perspective

This is a great tool for everyone! Have the child think of what else was going on at the time. Who

else was involved, and how might they have been feeling. If there was some sort of conflict, could

the other person have been preoccupied with something else that may have happened to them that

morning for instance. If there was discipline that a child was feeling unhappy about, get them to

reflect on whether an adult's decision was in their best interest or can they think of other outcomes

that could have occurred had discipline not been involved.

Explore All

Remember that reflection of positive emotions is just as beneficial as negative reflections. I think a

lot of people struggle with finding their ‘life purpose’ or whatever we want to call it, because we

haven’t had enough reflection on what actually gives us joy. How often do we hear ‘think back to

what made you happy as a child’? Well, starting reflection early could just focus a path in the world

now that career choice is becoming ever increasingly over­whelming.

Everything is about learning and practice. Some things work, some things don’t, or at least not all of

the time. Reflection is valuable for everyone, no matter their age

inevitable

Mindfulness and Meditation

This morning I got up, as usual at 5am. Anyone who hears of my early rising thinks I’m crazy, as

they know I don’t head to work until midday.

But, I get up early because I love the peace of the morning. I feel a thousand times better for the rest

of the day when I get up early as opposed to when I sleep in. Contrary to what would make sense, I

gain energy from being up early, and feel extremely drained if getting up after 7am.

I get up every morning with the intention of meditating. I LOVE to meditate. Again, I find it so

energising. I feel the difference echo throughout my whole day when I meditate first thing. I am a

nicer person to be around if that’s how I start the day.

Problem is, I am shocking at meditating. I know how I do it. I know why I do it. despite what science

may or may not say, or whether I am experiencing some sort of placebo effect or a real change, I

know how I feel when I do it. I just seem to be amazing at putting up every barrier known to mankind

in order to avoid doing it. And I have no idea why. I would 100% rather go on a 20km run in the cold,

than sit down for 20 minutes and do...nothing.

So, I registered for a 5 week meditation course and it starts tonight!...much to my delight when I got

up early this morning because, hey, if I’m going to a class tonight then I don’t have to do it this

morning...seriously, any barrier I can find!

Even though I feel like I love and am very open to the world of meditation, I am still incredibly

hesitant about actually going to a mediation workshop. In the very back of my head I have

unsubstantiated preconceived ideas about the type of hippie folk who are going to be there. So I

know, that someone who has never tried or had interest in trying something like meditation or

reading up on the benefits, would have those preconceived ideas at the fronts of their minds,

especially if someone were to suggest that just maybe, meditation would be an excellent skill for

their children to learn.

 This strange idea that we seem to have cultivated over time may actually be depriving kids of a

potentially life changing stress release technique that could not only benefit emotional health, but

also mental and physical health.

I would encourage everyone to try it, and I will report back about my workshop experiences, but if

you have no desire at all to give it a shot yourself, what does the evidence say about meditation?

These are a few studies I’ve found.

Meditation

Emotions are the main player in how we relate and engage with the world, and our sense of

satisfaction with doing so. Every decision has been derived in part by emotions, and throughout a

day we are constantly making decisions, which means we are constantly dealing with emotions. No.

We are constantly experiencing emotions, whether we are dealing with them, or even aware of them

as they constantly swirl through the body is another story.

If you think of a really chatty person, someone who just never shuts up, maybe you are more tolerant

than me, but it can really get on your nerves, especially as someone who is a little quieter and very

unlikely to talk over someone with confidence. When you are in the company of this overly chatty

person for an hour or so, it can be absolutely exhausting. It’s hard to think about anything else. If

something were to happen right there in front of you, you could be forgiven for missing, as you’d be

completely consumed with this friends memories of last week, and plans for next week.

UGH...

Now...imagine, if there were no social constrictions in place to alter anything, imagine verbalising

every thought that come into your head, in real time. Imagine doing it for a few minutes? An hour?

All day long? Despite your personality type (for instance, it doesn’t matter in the slightest that I don’t

like talking) you would become that annoying chatty person, but infinitely worse. You would never

get time to stop for a breath, you would be attempting to say seven different things at once, probably

using 11 different voices. Some of the things you would be saying would probably see you end up in

hospital, or jail, or maybe both...in this imaginary world where we say every thought that pops into

our minds.

My point? It is absolutely no wonder, that with an incredibly persistent, overly chatty person residing

in our heads, that more often than not our feelings get lost in the noise, and we become emotionally

unstable or unhealthy.

As an adult it’s easy to think, ‘ohhhh to be back in school and not have to worry about adult­y things’

but that is over­simplifying things. Kids go through so much. They are learning, their brains are still

under construction! And add the stress of the world they can put onto themselves, their persistently

chatty head friends can be even louder than ours.

Finding a way to shut that persistent friend up, just for a few minutes, is like letting the mind rest,

sitting down after running for years. When the mind is quiet, there is more room for focus, and this

focus can shift to emotions and how we are feeling. Mindfulness and meditation make efforts to do

just that, and it is because of these efforts that practices like meditation are becoming more

mainstream in the treatment of some mental health disorders, namely anxiety and meditation.

A Swedish study published in Nov 2014, found that mindfulness based practice was as effective as

talk therapy in the treatment of anxiety, depression, and severe stress responses. While this study

didn’t show mindfulness to be MORE effective, if you take into account the time, cost, availability,

and unnecessary stigma attached to consulting a psychotherapist, as opposed to a free skill that can

be learned and then practiced in the home, you can see which method may be favourable, or at

least interesting, to some.

How To

I am all for meditation. I love it, I see the benefits, I feel the changes, and I have read other people’s

stories and the benefits that they see.

Yet, I am terrible at actually sitting down to meditate. Every morning I wake at 5am and I have the

intent to sit down in the calm of the morning to meditate, because I know it will set my day up well.

But, I find every other menial task to perform in order to procrastinate.

Even though logically I know I want to do it, I think deep at the back of my mind somewhere, there

are the thoughts of the stigma surrounding meditation. Growing up, it just wasn’t something I ever

encountered. Maybe I knew what it was, and you would see ‘crazy hippies’ meditating on TV shows.

The word meditation seemed to be heavily associated with religion, and it definitely wasn’t

mainstream.

We are constantly encouraged and advised to take steps in the prevention of physical health

complications, yet we almost altogether neglect mental health and cruise through life not giving it a

second thought, until something goes wrong. And then, when people can’t deal with these issues, it

can be assumed they are weak, or ‘less than’ those who are in great mental health.

Everyone is in great mental health, until they aren’t.

Just like exercise and a nutritious diet, we should ALL, but especially children, be encouraged to

meditate in an effort to prevent mental health issues occurring. I wholeheartedly wish I had learned

to meditate when I was young, before I was influenced by society and the thoughts of others that in

no way impact me. Just like learning a language, it is easier as a child, and children who meditate

grow up with a emotional and mental health reserve they can pull from if the need arises.

There are so many resources readily available for us these days. Teaching children to meditate

might just be the most valuable gift they could be given. Here is a list of apps, websites, and

techniques to try.

● Headspace ­ https://www.headspace.com/

● GPS For The Soul ­ https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gps­for­the­soul/id586099254?mt=8

● Teaching Children Meditation ­ http://www.teachchildrenmeditation.com/connected­kids-
training/connected­kids­online­course­calm­kids/

● While searching for resources, I found a number of organisations (in the US) that promote

meditation and mindfulness in schools. It would be valuable to do a local search to see if

there is anything in your area. Mindfulness In Schools Project is a UK program that has had

incredible success ­  http://mindfulnessinschools.org/

● Free Meditation ­ http://www.freemeditation.com/

● The Conscious Life ­ http://theconsciouslife.com/meditation­resources

● MindUP ­http://thehawnfoundation.org/mindup/

● It is also worth doing a google search for meditation classes in you local area. I have just

signed up to a 5 week free course in Montreal. I have probably read all there is to read about

meditation, but having a ‘teacher’ speak the same words gives it a completely different

feeling.

Mindfulness

If meditation is still too much, what about mindfulness for children?

Taken from Psychology Today, ‘mindfulness is a state of active, open attention on the present.’

There is also a focus on experiencing our thoughts, feelings, and emotions as they occur, but

without judgement. Once we can do this for ourselves, there is more room for acceptance of others.

The great thing about developing mindfulness in children is that even though there are resources

and props designed to encourage the practice, you actually don’t need anything, the body, and

nature are the greatest props that can be used. We are constantly feeling, thinking, and having

emotions, so honing in on these natural occurrences is the all that is needed.

Breathing ­ Have the child lie on their back and place a book, or toy on their stomachs. Ask them to

focus on the movements of the toy and what it is in their body that is causing the movement. A good

way of timing this exercise is to start when the child is relaxed and the breath is slow. count out 10

breaths, and then have the child get up and jump or run around in order to speed up their breathing.

Once they are panting, have them lie back down and focus on the toy on the stomach again until

their breath is back to the normal tempo.

Journal ­ An emotions journal is a great way for kids (and adults) to gain awareness of emotions.

Writing in the morning (how you feel upon waking) and writing in the evening (how you feel after the

day’s events) can really help make sense of emotions, that can appear completely random when we

aren’t paying attention to them and to any patterns that may be present.

Nature ­ There are countless activities that can be done outside that promote mindfulness. If you just

take a walk in nature, inspiration will come.  ­ Patterns in water when a stone is thrown. ­ The movements in trees when wind is blowing. ­ How the leaves fall, in fall. ­ The patterns the ants create when working. ­ The different smells that rain produces. ­ Watching bubbles float on a calm day. ­ Watching the progression of a plant growing, or flower blooming over time.  ­ Watching the colours change in sunrise and sunset.

Life Cycle

So much in life is unknown, and unexpected. From second to second, minute to minute and year to

year, we simply can not know what is going to happen. The one and only thing that is certain in life

however, is that life itself will come to an end, for us all.

This is such a taboo subject. It is probably the most uncomfortable and unnatural thing to talk about,

but technically, it is the most natural thing that *will* happen. It is the one thing that connects all

human beings on earth, the one experience we will all share at some point.

Why do we try and hide this from children? Whether it’s subconscious or not, I think there something

in all of us that leads us to believe that we will beat the odds somehow, and bypass this natural

experience.

While there have been incredible advances medicine that mean we live through illnesses that in the

past would have taken life, unexpected, or what we deem untimely deaths still occur and they are

tragic, and unexpected! Failing to discuss the natural life cycle with children, may just increase the

shock factor when unfortunate events do occur. Failing to make the life cycle and open discussion

point enhances the subconscious, or other, feeling of immortality, and could in the long run be the

cause for people getting stuck in ruts, working unfulfilling jobs with the belief that something better

will come.

We are making too easy for ourselves to forget that this is our one shot, this IS life. It WILL come to

an end. I don’t know why I’m here, and my reason may be different from yours, but I do know that we

should be getting out there and doing everything in our power to enjoy whatever time we do get, and

appreciating the time we get to spend with the people we love.

Round Up

Health is such an individual experience. There are golden standards we can work off, or use the

base line of the absence of illness equating health, but it is so much more than that.

Working out what works for our own health requires a deep understanding of our minds and our

bodies. We must know the body in order to respect it.  We can listen to all the experts and read all of

their words, but there is no denying that what works for one person simply may not work for another.

It is easier to sift through the saturation of health information available, when we know and respect

the body.

Everyone has the goal of living a happy life. I believe with a balance of physical, mental, and

emotional health, comes happiness. Let’s work with kids early to promote this healthy balance, and

strive to set up a life of happiness for them.

I hope you’ve enjoyed this 31 day series. There is so much to cover, 31 days doesn’t seem nearly

enough. I have loved writing this series, and I have discovered new interests. While I will always love

to expand my knowledge of physical health and whatever amazing progressions are yet to come in

the healthcare field, mental and emotional health is where my interest now lies. There are so many

gaps in how we look at these topics, but I am so hopeful that these gaps will begin to close and the

well­being of those suffering mental and emotional health issues will be dramatically improved.

To the lovely friend who encouraged me to commit to writing this series, knowing how much it would

help me, I say a heartfelt thank you!

It is absolutely no wonder that the world of nutrition is confusing. In the last two weeks, there have

been two large studies come to light in mainstream media. One, stating that bacon and cured meats

can cause cancers, the other stating that low fat diets are less than adequate in the weight

management battle and we should adopt the low carb diet instead.

Different experts obviously have differing opinions, and most of them hav studies to back them up.

When it comes to diet however, there are simply too many variables to be able to categorically

decide whether one way of eating is better than the next. There are so many factors involved it

simply must come down to a person choice and personal decision that works well for you.
