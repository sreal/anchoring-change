Exercise: The Child's Brain & Learning

19 October 2015
Exercise and physical activity is known to be fundamentally important for physical health and disease prevention for everyone!
We KNOW it!
 There are hundreds/thousands of well designed studies of all different sizes, on all different age groups to support the need for exercise. So why, then, from the age of 5 (sometimes younger) do we sit at desks for hours a day, and in some cases, for the rest of our lives?

Besides the myriad of physical health issues this may be causing, there is now research that suggests that inactivity in the classroom has a direct relationship with learning difficulties in children. When I heard that there are schools in the US cutting back on, or removing altogether, physical education from the school curriculum, it was not just shocking, but also incredibly sad. I could naively assume that something like that would never happen in Australia, but the truth is, it’s probably not that unlikely.

Instead of being removed, the time dedicated to physical activity, or strenuous play, should be increasing, and children should be up and moving several times throughout the day, not once or twice through the week. It might just make learning easier for children!

So what are some of the ways that exercise affects (improves) the learning brain?

Increased blood flow by increasing the heart rate with exercise, also means increased blood flow and oxygen to and through the brain.
There is some research to suggest that exercise actually creates new brains cells within the Hippocampus of the brain. This is the section of the brain responsible for learning and memory.
Exercise is thought to improve the brain’s neuroplasticity, which essentially means the brains is more malleable, and forms connections more efficiently ie. better learning.
Exercise can reduce stress and anxiety, which are two big barriers to learning in the classroom. Improved attention spans have also been directly linked to increases in physical activity.
As important as exercise appears to be for the child's brain, the benefits are just as recognisable in the adult brain. Things like standing desks, or 'walk meetings' are becoming more popular and common in the workplace, and not just for a boost in calories burned, people report an incredible increase in productivity and ability to think clearly in the workplace.

Runners will also tell you that they use their runs not only for physical health improvements, but that they also do their best problem solving while out on their runs. I know this to be 100% true. Thoughts, of the helpful nature, tend to coming flowing in as soon as my heart rate increases on a run.

So, if we see the improvements in productivity and thought clarity associated with physical activity in the workplace, how are we not doing everything we can to make physical activity an essential part of the everyday in classrooms everywhere, thus making learning easier for children??

Well, I don't know the answer to that one, but I'll keep digging!!
