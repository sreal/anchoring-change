The Ear Bone's Connected To The...??

Yesterday we learnt that muscles do a whole lot of tensing, flexing, and pulling, and today we find out that all of that isn't done just to make us look like superheros with big muscles, the muscles do all their work just to move our bones around!
 Bones help us stand up straight, they help protect our vital organs, like the skull for the brain, or the ribs for the lungs and heart. Bones give us our human-y shape and stop us from looking like jellyfish.

Our bones are living, growing things! They are constantly remodelling, renewing and reshaping themselves. If a bone is broken, it can regrow and heal itself, but to make sure it heals in a straight line and can be used again, a doctor will often place a cast around the broken bone for extra support and protection.

The biggest bone in the body is the femur, the big bone in your thigh. The smallest bone in the body is inside the ear.

An adult has 206 bones. When we are born, some of these bones are in a number of different parts, and as we grow, the bones fuse together. Some children experience some discomfort as these bones shift and start to fuse together, we often refer to this discomfort as growing pain.

Looking after the health of your bones through your teenage years can mean excellent, strong bones later in life. This means that when you are older, you will be still be able to stand up straight, run around and do the things you love to do, and your bones will less likely fracture if you take a fall.
Calcium is one of the most important vitamins for bone health, and luckily it is easy to find in milk, yoghurt, cheese, and dark green leafy vegetables.


Exercise is also extremely important for the bones!! Exercise encourages the bones to keep growing and become stronger. The bones will be the strongest they will ever be when you get to your late teenage years. Once you are into your twenties, your bones start to decrease in strength. It is so important that as kids, you build up as much strength in the bones as you can, so that you have great strength reserves to pull from all through your life.

Parents : It is always best to get the recommended daily allowance of calcium from real food sources, not supplementation. If your child is lactose intolerant there are non dairy options!

Almonds, peanuts, brazil nuts
Canned salmon with the bones, or sardines for calcium & Vitamin D
Beans
Dark green leafy vegetables
Also remember that vitamin D helps the absorption of calcium, so adequate sun time is encouraged. You can also find vitamin D in food such as fish oils, and egg yolks.

Osteoporosis is known as the teenage disease, with adult consequences, what they do now will affect them later in life. It is hard as a teenager to think of something that may or may not happen when you're 50, so encouragement and education is the best you can do, as with most things, prevention is better than a cure. Bone health is especially important for teenage girls. Obviously, maintaining an optimal weight is ideal, nut remember that for the bones, being underweight in teenage years is just as problematic as being overweight. If your teen has irregular periods, this may be a sign they are underweight, or overtraining, and they should be assessed by a doctor.

There is also research to suggest that a high consumption of soft drink can lower the absorption of calcium, so this is also something to be aware of in teens.
