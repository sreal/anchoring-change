It's Not Just The Stomach!

The body uses digestion to change the food we eat, into the energy we need.



Digestion starts the moment food reaches the mouth

The teeth chew the food so it is small enough to swallow
The saliver in the mouth not only makes the food easy to swallow, but it also has special chemicals that break down the food to make the stomach's job easier
When you swallow the food, little muscles in your throat help to push the food to the stomach.

Not that you should try this, but, even if you're standing on your head when you swallow, the food will get up to the stomach.
Once the food is in the stomach, the gastric juices continue to break the food down.

The stomach sits higher than most people think, right up under the heart
When you say you have a stomach ache, usually it's not actually the stomach that's hurting.
The juices in the stomach are so strong that they can kill bad bacteria if it gets in there, this makes the stomach one of the best fighters in our immune system
Once the stomach has turned the food into a liquidy mixture, it starts to push it through to the small intestine

The small intestine keeps breaking down the food, and now it can be absorbed into the body as nutrients and minerals.
These nutrients get sent around the body by the blood, and the nutrients are used as energy.
The small intestine is looooooong, and food can take 4 hours to makes its way all the way through.
Digestion now continues through to the large intestine.

The large intestine is about 1.5m long.
It is responsible for absorbing water that you've been drinking, and any nutrients that the small intestine missed.
The large intestine also prepares the waste to be removed form the body...
Digestion is such a long and complicated process, when we eat foods that the body doesn't like, we are making it work extra hard!!

The body tells us if we've eaten something it doesn't like by giving us a sore tummy, or by not giving us a great burst of energy, like we get when we eat a healthy meal with fruits and vegetables!!

Parents There is a growing body of research to show just how significant digestive health is, not only for physical health, but also mental health. I will go into more of this research when I get to the mental health section.

With the endless amounts of information you can find on the internet, it is so hard to know what to take, and what to leave, especially when it comes to nutrition and digestion health...everyone has an opinion on what they think is the best diet. But there are 3 simple things that dieticians and health professionals tend to agree on, no matter their other recommendations:

Optimal fibre intake
Staying hydrated
Exercise
If you focus on these 3 things for your kids (and yourselves) you will be giving them a good headstart to health!
