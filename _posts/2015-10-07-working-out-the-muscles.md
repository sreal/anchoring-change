Working Out The Muscles

07 October 2015
Every time you walk. talk, sleep, breathe, jump, sneeze, or smile, your muscles are working!
 * You have around 640 muscles in your body.

There is a little debate about which is THE strongest, but your two strongest muscles are one found on the outside of the eye, and one in your tongue!

There actually 8 muscles in your tongue, that’s how we can chew up things like toffee.

It takes 17 muscles to smile, but 43 muscles to frown. So. Always smile :)

The heart is a muscle, but it is made up differently than the muscles in your arms or legs.

Muscles have great memories! That’s how we get better at sports, our muscles start to remember what to do and we don’t have to think about it so much. Or, if someone passes you a box that you think will be heavy, but it’s actually very light, your arms will spring upwards.

Your muscles are made of lots and lots of tiny, hair like ‘fibres’, muscles fibres. When we need to move, the brain sends a signal to the muscles fibres to shorten or lengthen, depending on the movement. If you move your foot towards your bottom, the muscles in the back of your leg is shortening, while the muscles on the front of your leg, are lengthening.

When we are born, we are born with all the muscles fibres we will ever have. When we play sports and ‘build’ muscle, we are are building the thickness of the muscle fibres, not the number of fibres.

Over your lifetime, your heart is the muscle that does the most work, it never stops pumping.

Muscles are incredible, they let us do everything we can do. Sometimes we need to think about moving a muscle, like when we decide to flex the bicep, and sometimes the muscles just do their jobs without being asked, like the heart beating, or the muscles in our bladders.

It is important to remember that what is good for our muscles that we can see (our arm and leg muscles) is equally as good for the heart muscles. This is why it is so important to eat well and to exercise. Exercising also means that we will be able to move how we want to, when we get older.
