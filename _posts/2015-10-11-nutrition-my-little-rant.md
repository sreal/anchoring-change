Nutrition: My Little Rant

11 October 2015
Nutrition is a topic that causes so much debate. We all need to eat, yet no one, not even experts in the field, can agree on a way of eating that is best for everyone. We are incredibly lucky to have such a huge selection when we go to the grocery store or fresh food markets, and as ungrateful as I know it sounds, this choice can just make it harder for us to decide on what’s best. Big food companies are all too aware of this, and they pay the big bucks for marketers to prepare the products with the decision fatigued consumer in mind ie. no matter the nutritional value, make this product as appealing and easy for the fastest possible money grab.
 Easy is good, but easy is not serving our society well. The number of nutrition related chronic diseases is at an all time high and continues to grow. Chronic diseases that in the past were saved for adults who had hounded their bodies for years with poor choices, are now showing up in the younger generation, and the ramifications of this will be shocking when they surface in the future.

It is no wonder, however, that children have trouble knowing how best to fuel their bodies, when us adults are having such a hard time figuring it out as well. And I get that we can't blame the experts either. It is almost impossible to conduct great research on nutritional habits because the results always end up being reductionist in nature, one thing is good or one thing is bad. In reality, a meal is rarely going to be just one item, it generally includes a range of different foods. It is hard to tell where we are going wrong.

No matter what other recommendations experts and health professionals provide for the public, there is one piece of advice I think everyone agrees on.

Eat more fruits and vegetables!!

Whether someone chooses to include or avoid things like meat. fish, dairy, grains, or legumes, we should first and foremost be eating as many fruits and vegetables as we can. The body wants them, the body needs them, and in most cases right now, our bodies are lacking in them.

And just my 2 cents worth, though I’m sure there still isn’t 100% agreement on this just yet, we should be avoiding added sugars and processed foods wherever we can.

Processed foods filled with sugars amd chemicals, that are lacking in anything fresh and natural can be found almost everywhere you go: schools, businesses, hospitals, even the majority of aisles in the supermarkets are filled with crap. It is hard to avoid. The best we can do is lead by example at home, try to educate our kids on sound nutrition, and try and instill good decision making in children so that when we aren't there and when they're faced with the abundance of poor choices that are inevitable in everyday life, they can make the best decisions for now and for their futures.

Another little thing we need to be aware of is the language we use around food. I wrote this article over on the BodyKinect website, so I don't want to repeat it here, but I think it is important to be aware of what we're saying in relation to food and diets, and to know that the little ears around us are picking up more than we would ever guess.

Well, that is a much longer rant than anyone needs to read on a Saturday night, but this topic fires me up. Tomorrow's follow up will be some tips and tricks to breaking down nutrion for children.
