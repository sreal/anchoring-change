I had been intending on trying Hemp Hearts since I moved to Canada (which is a long time ago, but you know, life gets in the way) so when Manitoba Harvest generously invited some Sweatpink ambassadors to give their products a try, I jumped at the opportunity. 
 Hemp products were tricky to find in Australia when I was living there, so what are these hemp hearts?

Hemp seeds are produced from the industrial hemp plant, Cannibis Sativa L, which is the same species of plant that produces cannabis, but is a different variety with completely different properties...ie, hemp seeds do not contain the psychoactive drug that cannabis is known for. Manitoba Harvest hemp products are all safe for consumption by all ages, young and old. Hemp hearts are simply shelled hemp seeds.

With those misconceptions out of the way, how do they taste? I was actually expecting these hemp hearts to be hard, like seed or nuts, but as the hemp hearts are by definition, shelled seeds, these babies are soft!

(Side note, because if I was wondering, then I'm sure someone else will be curious too...I tried to roast these to make them crunchy, but, it failed. Despite having them on a low heat, they burned but remained soft. So, just keep them as they are.)

Hemp hearts have a great taste that could really be paired with just about anything. While they smell a bit like grass, they taste very nutty, like a pistachio or pine nut, and I can imagine they would be delicious if added to a dukka!

Nutrition: A suggested serving size is 30g and they boast a massive 10g of plant-based protein (very easily digested) and 10g of omegas, 3 & 6, in great ratio. Omega 3 is an essential fatty acid that is fundamental in heart health, brain health and reducing inflammation in the body (great for athletes). Hemp hearts They are low in carbohydrates, and apparently, compared to other seeds and nuts, hemp seeds are low allergenic.

While research is lacking for the health benefits of hemp products, there are studies to suggest the beneficial effects on cardiovascular health in mice who were fed hemp products, as well as some claims that hemps seed consumption has cholesterol lowering effects. WHile there are many other anecdotal stories of the hemp health benefits, which you can take or leave, further research is in the works and will come to light in the near future.

While no food item on its own can be considered a super food, I think hemp hearts are an excellent addition to a whole food, nutrition rich diet. They taste great, have excellent nutritional qualities, and can be easily added to many recipes! Thumbs up from Meg! 


Recipe

Keeping things simple, I added my hemp hearts to my 2 ingredient banana pancakes. Are you ready for the recipe, grab your notepad and pen, coz I just made things complicated (not at all)!!

2 x Eggs
1 x Banana - mashed
1/2 a serve of hemp hearts (Don't tell anyone that this recipe isn't actually 2 ingredients, but I also add a pinch of baking soda, and a good pinch of cinnamon)
Whisk eggs, add the mashed banana and whisk some more, stir hemp hearts & baking soda & cinnamon into the batter, fry as you would regular pancakes in coconut oil.

I LOVE this recipe! It is so easy, so tasty, kid friendly, and a great post-run snack. The hemp hearts add great flavour and add to the nutritional composition of this easy snack.

I also tried some hemp hearts in my usual green smoothie. I'm sure they were great, but as I tend to add every ingredient i can find in the fridge, and then some more, into my smoothies, I just couldn't taste them.

Have you tried hemp hearts? Did you love them? What recipes should I add them to?
