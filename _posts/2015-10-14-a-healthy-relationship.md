A Healthy Relationship With Food

14 October 2015
A healthy relationship with food goes way beyond whether someone is a picky eater. It is about knowledge of food and maybe more importantly, knowledge of the body, it is about respect for both the body and for where the food is coming from. It is also about awareness of all the decisions we can make about food, and all of the decisions we think we are making but that are being made for us, unknowingly.
 * Know the food - Food is energy, we need it to live!! It sounds crazy, but we forget this sometimes. A little understanding of what food is made up of, and what it is delivering to the body, goes a long way. Knowing that fresh food from nature will give us so much more than something from a packet can ever give. Knowledge of where the food is coming from is also important. Take the time to explore a farmer's market with children, or have them start a small veggie patch, and then use these ingredients in the cooking.

Know and respect the body - When we know what the body wants, it is easier to make decisions about what to give it. If we know how the body responds to certain foods, how different foods make us feel and how they make us move, then we will naturally want to fill up first on what the body needs. What can be helpful for some (adults and children) is to keep a food journal. Ensure you steer clear of documenting numbers or calories in the journal. Keep it for energy levels, overall feeling of wellness, and any indications that the body isn’t loving a certain food. It is a great way to get to know the body.

Respect and compassion for others - Not everyone is going to eat the same way we do. There are many different reasons people eat the way they eat, religion, health issues, allergies, different tastes. Encouraging children to be respectful of others and to keep their eyes on their own plate may help reduce the defensive nature that can sometimes develop around the way we eat.

Be aware of decision making around food - There are so many factors that can influence our decision when it comes to what we choose to eat. Hormones, hydration, how rested we are, food advertising, society’s (unhelpful) language around food: good/bad/cheat/treat/diet... We could all be a little more mindful of what's happening inside and what's happening around us.

Setting up a healthy relationship with food from an early age will be beneficial for future physical and mental health.
