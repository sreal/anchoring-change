Nutrition Basics: Part 1

11 October 2015
While the body is alive, it is using energy, for every little thing it does. Every organ, and every system in the body needs energy to survive, and it gets this energy from food. It is hard to imagine how an apple can provide energy, but the body works its magic to pull all of the energy out of the apple. Everytime we eat, it is like we are recharging our batteries.

The digestive tract, that we talked about here, starts with the mouth, and it break down the food into tiny particles. These particles are shipped off to different parts of the body that need them the most, and they are turned into energy!

The 3 main groups that our foods are broken into by digestion are:

Carbohydrates

Carbohydrates can be quickly used by the body for energy.
They are broken down into glucose, which is a type of sugar.
If we eat more carbs than the body can use, we store the extra as fat.
Fruits and vegetables have excellent amounts of carbohydrates in them.
Proteins

Proteins are found in foods like eggs, meats, dairy, legumes, and vegetables.
Proteins are broken down into amino acids which are used to build and repair muscles.
Protein is the main part of mostly all the cells in the body.
Proteins take longer for the body to digest than carbohydrates, so it takes a little longer for us to be able to feel the energy after we eat a source of protein.
Fats

Fats can be found in many food items like: eggs, avocado, fish, cheese, meats, seeds.
The body needs fat for growth and energy.
Fats are quite complex, so the body works harder to break them down.
Your brain is mainly made up of fats, so for a healthy brain we need to consume healthy fats.
Different foods have different amounts of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats, so different foods will give you different amounts of energy at different times.
