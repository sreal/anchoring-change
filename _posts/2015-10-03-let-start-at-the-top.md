Let's Start At The Top...Braaaains

The health of any human being, child or adult, must be looked at in a holistic way. Physical, mental and emotional health hold equal importance for the health of the whole, and they must all be in balance to achieve optimal health.

To know that all three categories work as one and are dependant on each other, think of the last time you had a bad flu or stomach bug, you were physically very sick, but were you feeling happy at the same time? From my own experience, no you weren’t! You felt miserable, you couldn’t think straight, and felt like you could cry for days. Your physical state also affected your mental and emotional states. Think of the last time you had your heart broken. Was it just your emotional state affected? No, you probably felt physically sick, didn’t want to eat(or maybe you wanted to eat everything in sight), and I dare say you didn’t make you’re best decisions at that time either.

Everything is connected!!

But having said that, I am going to break it down, and because I find our physical state the easiest to understand, that is where I’m going to start. And, I’m going to break that down a little too!! And what better place to start, than at the top?

For The Kids

Hiding safe behind our eyes, nose, mouth and hair, inside our skulls, is our own personal computer that helps us walk, talk, breath, think, love and sleep. The brain helps us do everything! Messages are continuously being sent to the brain from the body, and the brain is always talking back to your body, letting it know just what to do.
 Different sections are responsible for different things:

The front of the brain: This part helps you plan out your actions, helps you pay attention, and helps you feel emotions like happiness and sadness.

The Top of the Brain: This part helps you touch things, know what shape they are, how warm or cool they are, and if something is too hot, like the water in in the bath, it helps pull your hand away, and protects you from any burns.

The Sides of the Brain: These parts helps you hear, and memorise things that you hear. It is also the part of the brain that helps you learn new things and remember new people you meet.

The Back of the Brain: This part helps the eyes to know what they are seeing, different shapes, colours, sizes, and if something is close or far away from us.

The brain has different sections, but it is so brilliant at talking together as one that we don’t even know which part is working as we live each day and do the things we love to do. Sometimes, if someone hurts a part of their brain, if they are in an accident or they get sick, one of these sections of the brain might be affected. So if you look at what each part controls, you might know which part isn’t working so well. Has someone lost some of their memory? Is someone having trouble planning out what they need to do? Is someone having trouble learning new things?
With the brain being responsible for so many things, it is easy to see how in some people, sometimes something doesn’t quite work properly!

How do we keep the brain healthy and happy?

The brain loves water!! So drink up!
The brain loves fruits and vegetables and all the good things they offer, so make sure your plate is full of colourful fruits and vegetables.
The brain loves healthy fats and actually, it is mostly made up of fat, so it doesn’t just love it, it NEEDS it
The brain loves to practice. It love when you try new things because it gets to practice and work out the best way of doing things
The brain loves to sleep. It works so hard, when you sleep it gets some well deserved rest and prepares for tomorrow.
The brain loves to stay clean. It loves when you get outside and get fresh air!
For Parents

The best way for kids to learn is to do and to see. Choose some fun activities that use the different lobes of the brain. Talk about which part is working while they are being creative (painting, dancing, storytelling), and which is working when they are exploring critical thinking (planning things out, learning new words, or reasoning).

Knowing how something works is the very best way of ensuring it continues to work well!!
