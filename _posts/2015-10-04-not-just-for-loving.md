Not Just For Lovin"...The Heart

04 October 2015
Out of all the muscles in the body, I’d say the heart is up there with the most important! It is just the size of your fist, but works so hard and gets so much done. It doesn’t ever, for your whole life, take so much as a morning tea break! And it does all it needs to do without us even asking. How incredible!
 And, what does the heart actually do?

The human body is filled with blood. This blood carries the air we breathe and the nutrients from the foods we eat, and delivers it to the body. Without the heart, the blood would just sit in our blood vessels and it wouldn’t be able to move. The heart is one big pump that squeezes the blood in and out and ensures it reaches all the way down to our toes.

When you sit still you may be able to feel your heart beating in your chest. Each minute, your heart beats around 70 times, and each time it beats it is pumping that healthy blood around the body. Each day, your heart pumps around 7200L of blood!! Think about the 2L jug of milk in your fridge...your hearts pumps about 3600 of those jugs, every.single.day!!

Even though the heart does so much without even needing to be asked, it is great if we do all that we can to make the heart’s job easier, that way it will continue to work well for you even when you grow older.

Drink lots of water. Which is easier, drinking water through a straw, or drinking honey through a straw? The more water you drink, the easier it is for the blood to pump through your heart through the blood vessels...no danger of clogging!
When you exercise your muscles, remember you will be exercising your heart as well. It can get boring pumping at the same speed day in and day out, your heart likes to mix things up. Jump up and down for a few minutes and just listen to what your heart does! You can tell that it gets excited when you’re moving because it starts to pump excitedly fast.
Your heart loves all the colours of the rainbow and the best way for it to see the colours, is for you to eat them. Fill up that plate with as many fruits and vegetables as you can, the more colourful your plate, the happier your heart will be.

One of the biggest stressors we can place on our hearts is to be in a constant state of stress, but this is so common in today’s world. We have the fight or flight response for a reason and it sets off an effective release of hormones and chemicals, through the body that help us think and act quickly to get us out of danger.

Chronic stress occurs when our lives are so busy that we are constantly in a state of stress and we constantly have increased levels of excitatory hormones, that are actually only meant for life and death situations. We so often get to adulthood and we don’t have a single tool or technique to deal with stress.

Your kids will have to deal with stress when they are older, but working with them early to learn relaxation techniques will give them a great head start for the future. The heartbeat is a great tool for discovering relaxation. Have your children increase their heart rate by doing something they like, then have them sit and really concentrate on the beat of their heart. Just have them sitting still and quiet until the heart beat is back to it’s resting rhythm. It doesn’t take too long but it can be quite a powerful exercise.
