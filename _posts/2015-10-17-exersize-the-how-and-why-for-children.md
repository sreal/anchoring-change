Exercise: The How & Why For Children

17 October 2015
 The benefits of exercise have been known forever, in one way or another.

Back in the good ol’ days, maybe the physiology of exercise was not understood, or even contemplated, but people knew that to survive, they needed to be strong, be able to run, hunt, fight. If they didn’t do it, they knew they’d lose it, which ultimately meant, death.

Now, we know an incredible amount about exercise physiology, how exercise works, and how much the body needs exercise to stay functional. Even though we still very much need to be physically active to survive, this is no longer the way we see it! For some, exercise as a chore we’ve been told we need to do by a cranky old high school gym teacher (I have great respect for all PE teachers, I have just heard these statements from others...promise).

Exercise can feel hard! In an age where every single thing in our lives has been designed to make our lives easier, something hard doesn’t see itself on the top of our priority list. Unfortunately, this whole scenario of easy, inactive living may mean we all get a really easy, really short life.

So what do we know are the benefits of exercise?

Improved heart health

Weight control, which in itself is fundamental in disease prevention

Strengthening of bones and muscles, which increases functionality now and later in life

Optimal brain health, focused thinking and increased learning

Improvements in mental health and feelings of wellbeing

Ability to run for the bus (you don’t see that one in the textbooks, but hey, why not?)

Not only is exercise great for disease prevention, or treatment & management of disease… it just completely and astonishingly improves our quality of life! It is hard to imagine how good the body is designed to feel until you feel it. We get so used to the puffing after walking up stairs, or the sore legs from a day shopping, or not being fast enough to run for the bus, that we start to think it’s just normal, it’s how everyone feels! But it shouldn’t be.

We constantly hear how much a toddler can run around for hours, that they're always on the go. How many times has a mother told her toddler to 'stop running, slow down!'. I definitely don't believe that kids just start to listen to their parents and they actually slow down, but I do wonder when they make the switch from the naturally physically active child, to the child who has no desire to get up from the computer screen. Most likely, it is when they start school and are asked to sit behind a desk for 6+hrs a day and concentrate.
Tomorrow I will write a bit more about the connection between exercise and the learning brain.

When spurting out the health benefits of exercise doesn't work, what can we do?

Like anything else, leading by example is key. Being an active child is a whole lot easier when living in an active family.

Building a love that turns into a habit is easier from a young age, so if you can, start them early!

It is a great idea to get the child exposed to a big variety of sports and physical activities as possible. Trying one sport and not loving it, does not mean that a child is not ‘the active type’, it means they haven’t found something that works for them.

Team sports
Individual sports
Endurance
Sprint & speed
Adventure
Relaxation
Competitive
Progressive
Repetitive
The list could go on!

And, saving the best 'til last...get outside and play! There is so much learning that can be combined with outside play. Learning about the body, and learning about the body's place in the environment is priceless for kids and their development.

What have you found is the key to getting or keeping your kids active?
